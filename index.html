        <h3>The origin of AI</h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;In the first half of the 20th century, science fiction familiarized the world with the concept of artificially intelligent robots. By the 1950s, we had a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers with the concept of artificial intelligence (or AI) culturally assimilated in their minds. One such person was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, a young British polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of artificial intelligence. Turing suggested that humans use available information as well as reason in order to solve problems and make decisions, so why can’t machines do the same thing?<br>&emsp;&emsp;From 1957 to modern dat, AI has flourished. Computers technology progressed to store more information and became faster, cheaper, and more accessible. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine learning</a> algorithms also improved, and people got better at knowing which algorithm to apply to their problem.</p>

        <h3>Current Limitations</h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;When we think about the limitations of AI, we have to keep in mind that this is still a very rapidly evolving set of techniques and technologies, so the science itself and the techniques themselves are still going through development. There are limitations that are purely technical. Questions like, can we interpret an algorithm's choices, outcomes, and predictions that it’s making? Then you’ve also got a set of practical limitations. Questions like, is the data accessible?<br>&emsp;&emsp;Although these limitations seem to be a bit extreme, many philosophers and computer scientists theorize that these obstacles can be overcome. If this proves to be true, there is no doubt that humanity could create a general purpose, all-knowing Artificial Intelligence that would shape humanities entire future.</p>

        <h3>The future of humanity</h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;There is no doubt that Artificial Intelligence will be explored further and continue to be incorporated into our lives, but the real question is how will it shape our future. The type of society that we will end up living in is still a heavily debated subject. Once it arrives, general AI will begin taking jobs away from people, millions of jobs—as drivers, radiologists, insurance adjusters. In one possible scenario, this will lead governments to pay unemployed citizens a universal basic income, freeing them to pursue their dreams unburdened by the need to earn a living. In another, it will create staggering wealth inequalities, chaos and failed states across the globe.<br>&emsp;&emsp;AI “scientists” will eventually be tasked to solve all the mysteries that humanity could not possibly conceptualize, such as dark matter and dark energy. Once complete AI should have no problem colonizing and transforming the entire cosmos. Leaving us with an altered version of the universe we currently live in, for the better or worse.</p>
